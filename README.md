## Strange Loop 2015

This is the code from the talk [Literate Interactive Coding:
Devcards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Z_g2fnEDg)

You can find more information on devcards and figwheel here:

Since I haven't release sonic-cljs yet, you will have to download and
install that locally if you want to get this demo running.
